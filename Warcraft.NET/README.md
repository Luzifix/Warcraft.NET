# Warcraft.NET

## About
Warcraft.NET is a open source C# library for World of Warcraft binary file formats. The goal of the library is to support following game versions:
- Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5)
- Warlords of Draenor (6.2.4)
- Legion (7.x.x)
- Battle for Azeroth (8.x.x)
- Shadowlands (9.2.x)

## Licensing
Warcraft.NET is Free Software, and is distributed under the GPLv3 license. This means, in simple terms, that you are free to do whatever you want with the source code and any binaries compiled or generated from it as long as you pass on those rights to anyone aquiring a copy of the source code or binaries. The full licence can be read in the file "LICENSE" at the root of the source tree, or at http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/, where a more people-friendly summary is also available.

The use of the GPLv3 license and not the LGPLv3 license is a conscious choice by me. If you're unsure what this means, it means that any software that links to or makes use of this library must also be licensed under the GPLv3 license or later, and carry the same rights and grants of rights as the library itself. I am of the firm opinion that closed source software (with certain exceptions) stifles creativity and inhibits technological progress. Share, develop, and be wonderful to each other. Don't adhere to the old closed-source ways, and embrace the wonderful world of free software.
